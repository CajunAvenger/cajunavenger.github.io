# The Ultimate Pokemon Picker
Find your favorite Pokemon for each generation, each type, each gen of each type, of all time, and more! [Try it here!](https://cajunavenger.github.io/)

### The Main Grid
Click the boxes in the grid to be given a selection of everything that meets the criteria and pick your favorites. You can now also remove a pick from your box by clicking again and selecting the X sprite.

### The Final Favorites
The last square in each row and column will give you all the Pokemon you picked before it, for the ultimate showdown of who your favorite child is.

### The Shiny Charm
Clicking on the Shiny Charm will put you in Shiny Mode until you click it again. Clicking on a Pokemon box in Shiny Mode will turn that Pokemon shiny rather than repicking it. While in Shiny Mode you can also clickk on a new line of text by the Shin Charm to instead convert *all* the sprites to their shiny form, even the new ones that you pick.
### The Team Grid
In the bottom left there's a section for selecting your team of six. To do this, click one of the boxes, which will then display "Picking...", then click any of the Pokemon in the grid boxes* and it will be copied over to that box. If you change the copied box, the team box won't change with it, which you can use to put unranked Pokemon in the team.

\* Except the Favorite Spinda box, working on that one!

### Build-a-Spinda Workshop
You can now create your own custom Spinda! At the four corners of the box are number inputs where you can put a number from 0-16 to move Spinda's 4 spots left/right or up/down. Or you can randomize your Spinda until they turn dizzy.

### And Alcremie too!
There's now a spot for Alcremie forms, first picking the base form and then opening a second box for toppings.

## Write, Import, Download
At the very bottom of the page there are three buttons and a textbox.

**Download Image** is easy, it downloads your result as a single .png file. This should work for mobile users now as well.

**Write Code** will convert the grid into a text form. You can save this to continue working on it later, or manually edit it, see Overwriting.

**Import Code** then takes that code written in the textbox and puts it back into the grid.

#### Overwriting
If you want to do something like put Galarian Meowth as your favorite Gen 1 gimmick or Swellow as your favorite regional bird, put a filler Pokemon in that position, then click Write Code, replace that Pokemon's name with the one you want, then click Import Code. Most Pokemon will just be their names capitalized (SWELLOW), but alternate forms will have a tag (MEOWTH_2). You can verify a name by putting it in the grid by itself and writing the code.
